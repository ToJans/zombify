NuGet Package Thinking
=======================

- The core zombify test runner has
  - a pre-built node package - including node.exe and zombie with contextify built
  - a pre-built XSP package
  - some javascript as a base test context

  - This means we could use Jasmine, which is supported by R#
    - But this is still geared towards client-side testing

- An additional package would
  - Bundle a default mocha.opts
  - Add some more node_modules (mocha, mocha-cakes, coffeescript)
  - a base 'System' class
  - a base 'Client' class
  - code packages for mixing in functionality specific test helpers on the client

  - Mocha isn't supported by the IDE at the moment :'(
  - Could hook it into R#?
  - Could I just mostify the project file to dump out errors???
  - <Import Task>
  -   <Run Node>
  -   <Read results>
  -   <Spit out errors with error code>
    - Apparently possible with MSBuild, but means running as part of build?

- The (optional) server package contains
  - a DLL for enabling IPC (maybe I can inject this by being really clever if
    I am hosting XSP within my own runner?
